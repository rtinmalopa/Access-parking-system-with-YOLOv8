# Access-parking-system-with-neural-networks
Goals:

1. Process an overview of artificial intelligence methods for object detection from camera sensors.
2. Implement an artificial intelligence method for detecting car license plates from the camera.
3. Link the implemented solution with the access system software.
4. Evaluate the performance of the implemented models.
